 Thin slice of a Calculator done via Inside-out TDD (UI done in ReactJS)
 
 Thin Slice: Add Function
 
 ### Notes
 #### In this kata:
 - chose to use JS Closures as the modules instead of Classes (just for fun)
 - used basic functional React components
 - went with an inside-out TDD approach vs. an outside-in approach
    - either way is fine, just figured we'd try inside-out this time
- Did not incorporate typescript due to time, but TS is great, we can always add that
