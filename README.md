# calculator-kata
 Thin slice of a Calculator done via Inside-Out TDD.
 - UI done in ReactJS
 
 **Thin Slice**: Add Function
 
 ### Notes
 #### In this kata:
 - chose to use JS Closures (functional modules) instead of Classes
 - used basic functional React components
 - went with an inside-out TDD approach vs. an outside-in approach
    - either way is fine, just figured we'd try inside-out this time
- Did not incorporate typescript due to time, but TS is great, we can always add that
- tried out the Ava test framework (instead of something like Jest, Mocha, or Tape)
